## Q&A
1. Is my computer compatible?

> We tried targeting as many computers as possible but for now, the application is only available for **All Macs (Silicon-Chip and Intel-Chip based)** and **Windows x64** (your computer is probably x64, Windows arm isn't popular at the time I write this).

2. What version do I download?

HINT: `x.x.x` means the version of the launcher you are about to download. Try to pick the newest one, but actually there is an auto-updater built-in so it's gonna update ;)

> **If you are on Windows**, download the `OpenVoxel-Launcher Setup x.x.x.exe` file and open it to run the launcher installer. Enter the required parameters (like installation path) and then click install. It will create a shortcut on your Desktop.
> 
> For a portable version, check out the `OpenVoxel-Launcher x.x.x.exe` file that contains everything.

> **If you are on Mac**, download the `OpenVoxel-Launcher-x.x.x-arm64.dmg` (if you are on Silicon-Chip based Mac, else it's `OpenVoxel-Launcher-x.x.x-universal.dmg`) file and open it to begin the installation process. Drag and Drop the launcher in the Applications folder. Once this is done, open the app that is in the Applications folder and you're all set!

> The `.blockmap`, `latest.yml` and `latest-mac.yml` are for the built-in updater, don't worry about it.

4.  Is it free?

> Yes! The app itself is free, but you still need a **Minecraft Account** to play. We _do not_ support cracks.
